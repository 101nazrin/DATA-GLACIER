## üìã Pre-Consolidation Checklist

Before running the consolidation script:

- [ ] I have identified all my Data Glaciers repositories
- [ ] I have the URLs for each repository
- [ ] I have created a new empty repository for the consolidated version
- [ ] I have backed up my original repositories (just in case)
- [ ] I'm in the "Data Glaciers" directory
- [ ] I'm ready to proceed with consolidation

## üö® Safety Reminders

- **Double-check**: Make sure you're only including Data Glaciers repositories
- **Backup**: Your original repositories will remain untouched, but it's good practice to have backups
- **Test**: Try the process with one repository first to make sure it works as expected
- **Verify**: After consolidation, verify that all your Data Glaciers work is included

## üìû Need Help Identifying Repositories?

If you're unsure about which repositories to include:
1. Check the repository creation date (should be during your internship period)
2. Look at the commit messages for Data Glaciers references
3. Check the README files for project descriptions
4. When in doubt, exclude the repository - you can always add it later

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Identify**: List all your Data Glaciers repositories
2. **Prepare**: Get the URLs for each repository
3. **Configure**: Add them to `data_glaciers_repos.txt`
4. **Consolidate**: Run the consolidation script
5. **Verify**: Check that everything is included correctly
